# <Hoirison-Web-Services>

## Description
The purpose of this project is to refactor the Horiseon website to utilize semantic HTML in order to optimize the website for accessibility. By applying sematic HTML users will be able to better interact with the website and attract audiences that may have specific accessibility needs and improve Horiseon's search engine fingerprint.
