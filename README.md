# <Hoirison-Web-Services>

## Description
The purpose of this project is to refactor the Horiseon website to utilize semantic HTML in order to optimize the website for accessibility. By applying sematic HTML to the website the user's experieince will be imporved by providing details intended for audiences that may have specific accessibility needs. As a general philosophy I believe the internet provides great opertunities for all people to interact with ease and websites in general should be optimized to assist audiences that may have the need for it. Horiseon's search engine fingerprint will also be improved by the optimizations demonstrated in this repo.
